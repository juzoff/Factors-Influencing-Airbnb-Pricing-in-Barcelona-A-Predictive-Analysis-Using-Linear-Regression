## •	3.1. Third Linear Model Development and Analysis After Stepwise Regression
- Fitted a refined linear model (third model) using predictors selected after the stepwise regression process.

## •	3.2. Residual Plot Before Handling Large Residuals
- Visualized the residuals to assess any patterns or unusually large residuals that might affect model accuracy.

## •	3.3. Identifying and Removing Data Points with Large Residuals
- Detected and removed observations where the residuals fell outside the acceptable range, as defined by the interquartile range (IQR) thresholds.
- Data points with residuals outside the range Q1 – 1.5 * IQR, Q3 + 1.5 * IQR were treated as "outliers" in terms of model fit. These points were removed to refine the model.

## •	3.4. Fourth Linear Model Development with Significant Attributes After Handling Large Residuals
- Refitted the linear model after removing data points with large residuals and assessing its performance.

## •	3.5. Residual Plot After Handling Large Residuals
- Reassessed residual distribution to ensure randomness and absence of discernible patterns.
