# Branch 4: Final Model Development and Evaluation
## •	4.1. Selection of Significant Attributes for Fifth Linear Model
- Fitted a fifth linear regression model on the cleaned dataset from 3.4 (after removing large residuals).
- Extracted predictors with p-values below the 0.08 threshold, excluding the intercept.
- Constructed a new formula and refitted the model with these significant attributes.

## •	4.2. Final Linear Model Development After Handling Large Residuals
- Fitted a refined linear regression model using the subset of significant attributes.
- Summarized the model to evaluate the significance of predictors and overall model fit.
