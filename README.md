# Branch 4: Final Model Development and Evaluation
## •	4.1. Selection of Significant Attributes for Fifth Linear Model
- Fitted a fifth linear regression model on the cleaned dataset from 3.4 (after removing large residuals).
- Extracted predictors with p-values below the 0.08 threshold, excluding the intercept.
- Constructed a new formula and refitted the model with these significant attributes.

## •	4.2. Final Linear Model Development After Handling Large Residuals
- Detected and removed observations in the fifth linear model where the residuals fell outside the acceptable range, as defined by the interquartile range (IQR) thresholds.

- Data points with residuals outside the range Q1 – 1.5 * IQR, Q3 + 1.5 * IQR were treated as "outliers" in terms of model fit. These points were removed to refine the model.
- A final linear regression model was developed using the refined dataset, ensuring improved model accuracy and robustness after addressing large residuals.

## •	4.3. Final Linear Model Residual Analysis/Evaluation and Multicollinearity Check
- Performed residual analysis by plotting residuals versus fitted values to ensure randomness.
- Conducted a final multicollinearity check using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to ensure that there no potential collinearity issues.

## •	4.4. Final Random Forest Model Development
- Trained a final Random Forest model using the cleaned dataset in 4.2, with price as the target variable.

## •	4.5. Final Random Forest Residual Analysis/Evaluation
- Plotted residuals against predicted values for the final Random Forest model to ensure randomness and assess model performance.
