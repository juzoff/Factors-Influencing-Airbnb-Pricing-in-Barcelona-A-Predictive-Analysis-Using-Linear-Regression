# Factors-Influencing-Airbnb-Pricing-in-Barcelona-A-Predictive-Analysis-Using-Linear-Regression
### Note: This project is organized into multiple branches on GitHub, each correlating with a different portion of the assignment. To explore specific sections, please select the branch that corresponds to the task or analysis you are interested in. 

This project analyzes the Barcelona Airbnb listings dataset to identify key factors influencing pricing in the city's short-term rental market. It explores property attributes like location, amenities, and host characteristics, using linear regression to quantify the relationship between these factors and nightly prices.
